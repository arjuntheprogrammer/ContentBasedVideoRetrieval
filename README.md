# Content Based Video Retrieval System

## General Introduction
Lecture videos are becoming ubiquitous medium for e-learning process. E-lecturing has evolved more competent popular lectures. The extent of lecture video data on the
World Wide Web is increasing fastly. Therefore, a most appropriate method for retrieving video within huge lecture video library is required. The text displayed in a
lecture video is closely related to the lecture content. Therefore, it provides a valuable source for indexing and retrieving lecture video contents.

## Problem Statement
In the last decade e-lecturing has become more and more popular. E-lecturing has
evolved more competent popular lectures. These videos consist of textual information
on slides as well as in presenterâ€™s speech. The amount of lecture video data on the
World Wide Web (WWW) is growing rapidly. Therefore, a most appropriate method
for retrieving video within huge lecture video library is required, a more efficient
method for video retrieval in WWW or within large lecture video archives is urgently
needed. The objective of the system is to retrieve a video on the basis of its contents
rather than retrieving video according to its title and metadata description in order to
provide an accurate result for the search query.

## Technology Used
1. FFMPEG - FFmpeg is a free software project that produces libraries and programs for handling multimedia data.
2. Tesseract - Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems.
3. OpenCV - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions
mainly aimed at real-time computer vision
4. Django - Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
